# Trove-Memento-Translator

Google Sheets script to translate Alpha Legacy's [Memento Checklist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ymlTA_4QCFFiM7im2lOlgPT6ISKisSsoXCa0SZrbvoQ/edit#gid=1365838150).

# Installation

Currently, you need to:

• Make a copy of the spreadsheet linked above.

• Add the scripts in the editor (Tools -> Script editor)

• Set the starting function to `main`

• Set a trigger using the steps below.

**Making a trigger**

This step is required until a solution for automation that allows worksheet importing is found.

• In the script editor, click the clock button to access the project's control panel.

• Add a trigger.

• Set the executed function to `Main`.

• Set the event source to "based on current spreadsheet".

• Set the event to "On open".

You might get notifications from the script failing if it ever does. Unsure if there's a way to disable that, so feel free to set it so it gives the least amount if you aren't interested.

Here's hoping a clean solution can be made!
